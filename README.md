# TUF-on • Universal Flow Theory Portal 🌌

Welcome to the official repository of **TUF-on**, the experimental and theoretical portal for the **Theory of Universal Flow (TDUF)** — an emerging scientific framework aiming to explore the fundamental structure of reality through causal fields, coherent forces, and light-based synchronization.

## 🧠 Purpose

> "We're not just building a game — we're shaping a new paradigm of scientific knowledge."

TUF-on is a futuristic science portal built with cutting-edge web technologies to:
- Present and evolve the **TDUF** theoretical model
- Enable interactive simulations and citizen science
- Connect experimental data to user-driven hypotheses
- Build a community of theorists, explorers, and innovators

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom sci-fi UI
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Canvas Interactions:** Custom WebGL / HTML5 Canvas
- **Storage & Auth:** Supabase (planned)
- **Multilingual Support:** `next-intl` (coming soon)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
